    <blockquote>
        Whenever Django encounters include() (django.conf.urls.include()), it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.
        <small><cite title="url include">url include()</cite></small>

    <p>To mount included onto root /, do:</p>
    <div class="indent-small">
    <code>
        <span>url(r'^', include(...))</span>
    </code>
    </div>    
</div>
