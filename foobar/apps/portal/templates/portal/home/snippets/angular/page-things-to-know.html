<strong>DOM Manipulation</strong><br>
Stop trying to use jQuery to modify the DOM in controllers. Really. That includes adding elements, removing elements, retrieving their contents, showing and hiding them. Use built-in directives, or write your own where necessary, to do your DOM manipulation. See below about duplicating functionality.

If you're struggling to break the habit, consider removing jQuery from your app. Really. Angular has the $http service and powerful directives that make it almost always unnecessary. Angular's bundled jQLite has a handful of the features most commonly used in writing Angular directives, especially binding to events.

<strong>Angular Execution Context vs Angular Digest</strong><br>
Angular modifies the normal JavaScript flow by providing its own event processing loop. This splits the JavaScript into classical and Angular execution context. Only operations which are applied in Angular execution context will benefit from Angular data-binding, exception handling, property watching, etc...

<strong>The separation of the controller and the view is important because:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>The controller is written in JavaScript. JavaScript is imperative. Imperative is a good fit for specifying application behavior. 
        <span class="text-danger">The controller should not contain any rendering information (DOM references or HTML fragments)</span>.</li>
    <li>The view template is written in HTML. HTML is declarative. Declarative is a good fit for specifying UI. 
        <span class="text-danger">The View should not contain any behavior</span>.</li>
    <li>Since the controller is unaware of the view, there could be many views for the same controller. This is important for re-skinning, device specific views (i.e. mobile vs desktop), and testability.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
 A directive is a <span class="text-info">behavior or DOM transformation</span> which is triggered by the presence of a custom attribute, element name, class name or comment. 
 A directive allows you to extend the HTML vocabulary in a declarative fashion.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Angular made its valid points on the separation of the controller and the veiw.</li>
    <li>From above experiments, as long as no DOM manipulation inside controller, ng just ignores whatever non-ng JS does on DOM, and 
        manipulating DOM via jQuery/bootstrap.js seem having no effects on ng digesting (ng only cares those entering angular execution context, 
        that is, the $watchers and $listeners ...).
    </li>
    <li>
        Considering angular-ui for boostrap always falls behind bootstrap.js, just use bootstrap.js, 
        forget the angular scaring tactics!
    </li>
    <li>
        Really a crazy ng directive fun? well ng directive is a double edged sword. Can be good, can be evil. Think about how
        many times one thought one devloped a great widget, component, or an object class, and turned out 
        to be disastrous when minor changes needed in the future!
    </li>
</ul>
